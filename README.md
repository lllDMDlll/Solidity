# Solidity
Some Solidity code and contract examples
 
The ICO contracts are based on code by TokenMarket LTD. I modified their ICO setup in an attempt to make a general
batch of contracts that can be used with almost any ICO.

These contracts are still undergoing changes and require much more editing to be considered functional.
