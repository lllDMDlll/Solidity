# Solidity
Some Solidity code and contract examples
 
The ERC20 ICO contracts are generic and can be applied to most ICOs using Open Zeppelin.
The ERC223 ICO contracts are also generic, but more experimental than the ERC20.

I created these contracts in an attempt to make a general batch of contracts that can be used with almost any ICO with just a few simple changes.
